## BL1

> This stage begins execution from the platform's reset vector in trusted ROM at EL3. BL1 code starts at `0x00000000` (trusted ROM) in the FVP memory map. The BL1 data section is placed at the start of trusted SRAM, `0x04000000`. The functionality implemented by this stage is as follows.

- BL1 performs minimal architectural initialization as follows.
  - Exception vectors
  - MMU setup
  - Control register setup
- Platform initialization
- BL2 image load and execution
  - BL1 loads a BL2 raw binary image from platform storage, at a platform-specific base address
  - BL1 passes control to the BL2 image at Secure EL1, starting from its load address
  - BL1 also passes information about the amount of trusted SRAM used and available for use. This information is populated at a platform-specific memory address

## BL2

> BL1 loads and passes control to BL2 at Secure-EL1. BL2 is linked against and loaded at a platform-specific base address (more information can be found later in this document). The functionality implemented by BL2 is as follows.

- Architectural initialization
- Platform initialization
- BL3-0 (System Control Processor Firmware) image load
  - BL2 loads **the optional BL3-0 image** from platform storage into a platform-specific region of secure memory
- BL3-1 (EL3 Runtime Firmware) image load
- BL3-2 (Secure-EL1 Payload) image load
  - BL2 loads **the optional BL3-2 image** from platform storage into a platform- specific region of secure memory
- BL3-3 (Non-trusted Firmware) image load
  - BL2 loads the BL3-3 image (e.g. **UEFI or other test or boot software**) from platform storage into **non-secure memory** as defined by the platform (0x88000000 for FVPs)
- BL3-1 (EL3 Runtime Firmware) execution
  - BL1 passes control to BL3-1 at the specified entrypoint at EL3
  - BL2 relies on BL3-1 to pass control to BL3-3 once secure state initialization is complete

## BL3-1

> The image for this stage is loaded by BL2 and BL1 passes control to BL3-1 at EL3. BL3-1 executes solely in trusted SRAM. BL3-1 is linked against and loaded at a platform-specific base address (more information can be found later in this document). The functionality implemented by BL3-1 is as follows.

- Architectural initialization
- Platform initialization
  - GICv2 initialization
  - GICv3 initialization
  - Power management initialization
  - Runtime services initialization
  - BL3-2 (Secure-EL1 Payload) image initialization
  - BL3-3 (Non-trusted Firmware) execution
