## Overview

HW: STM32L053

### Power consumption range

- Range 1: VDD 1.71 ~ 3.6, CPU up to 32 MHz
- Range 2: full VDD range, CPU up to 16 MHz
- Range 3: full VDD range, CPU up to 4.2 MHz

### Modes

- `Sleep`
  - Only the CPU is stopped.
  - All peripherals continue to operate.
  - All peripherals can wake up the CPU when an interrupt/event occurs.
  - Power consumption at 16 MHz is about 1 mA with all peripherals off.
- `Low-power run`
  - is achieved with
    - MSI RC oscillator set to the lowspeed clock (max 131 kHz),
    - execution from SRAM or Flash memory,
    - internal regulator in low-power mode.
- `Low-power sleep`
  - is achieved by entering Sleep mode with the internal voltage regulator in low-power mode.
  - All I/O pins keep the same state as in Run mode.
  - When wakeup is triggered by an event or an interrupt, the system reverts to the Run mode with the regulator on.
- `Stop mode`
  - achieves the lowest power consumption while retaining the RAM and register contents and real time clock.
  - All clocks in the Vcore domain are stopped.
  - The PLL, MSI RC, HSE crystal and HSI RC oscillators are disabled.
  - The LSE or LSI is still running.
  - The voltage regulator is in the low-power mode.
  - All I/O pins keep the same state as in Run mode.
  - Some peripherals featuring wakeup capability can enable the HSI RC during Stop mode to detect their wakeup condition.
  - The device can be woken up from Stop mode by any of the EXTI line, in 3.5 µs. It can be
    - any GPIO EXTI.
    - the PVD output.
    - the comparator 1 event or comparator 2 event (if internal reference voltage is on)
    - the USB/USART/I2C/LPUART/LPTIMER wakeup events.
    - the RTC alarm/tamper/timestamp/wakeup events **if with RTC**.
- `Standby mode`
  - is used to achieve **the lowest power consumption**.
  - The internal voltage regulator is switched off so that the entire Vcore domain is powered off.
  - The PLL, MSI RC, HSE crystal and HSI RC oscillators are also switched off.
  - The LSE or LSI is still running **if with RTC**.
  - **The RAM and register contents are lost** except for registers in the Standby circuitry (wakeup logic, IWDG, RTC, LSI, LSE Crystal 32 KHz oscillator, RCC_CSR register)
  - The device exits Standby mode in 60 µs when
    - an external reset (NRST pin)
    - a rising edge on one of the three WKUP pins
    - an IWDG reset **if with RTC**
    - RTC alarm (Alarm A or Alarm B), RTC tamper event, RTC timestamp event or RTC Wakeup event occurs, **if with RTC**

:::danger
The RTC, the IWDG, and the corresponding clock sources **are not stopped automatically** by entering Stop or Standby mode.The LCD is not stopped automatically by entering Stop mode.

## Standby with RTC Alarm

### Pinout & Configuration

- Timer
  - RTC
    - Mode
      - Activate Clock Source
      - Activate Calendar
      - Alarm A -> internal Alarm A
    - Configuration
      - Parameter Settings
        - General -> Asynchronous Predivider value = 124
        - General -> Synchronous Predivider value = 295
        - 37 KHz / (124 + 1) / (295 + 1) == 1 (Depend on clock source)
      - NVIC Settings
        - RTC global interrupt -> Enable

### Clock Configuration

Set RTC clock.

### Example

```cpp title="rtc.c"

...

void MX_RTC_Init(void)
{
    ...

    /* USER CODE BEGIN Check_RTC_BKUP */
    if(HAL_RTCEx_BKUPRead(&hrtc, RTC_BKP_DR0) == 0x1234) return;

    ...

    HAL_RTCEx_BKUPWrite(&hrtc,RTC_BKP_DR0,0x1234);
    /* USER CODE END Check_RTC_BKUP */

    ...
}

...

```

```cpp title="main.c"

...

/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
RTC_TimeTypeDef sTime;
RTC_DateTypeDef sDate;
RTC_AlarmTypeDef sAlarm;
/* USER CODE END PV */

...

int main(void) {

    ...

    /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
    // Check the Standby flag
    if(__HAL_PWR_GET_FLAG(PWR_FLAG_SB) != RESET) {
        // Clear the Standby flag
        __HAL_PWR_CLEAR_FLAG(PWR_FLAG_SB);
        printf("Wake up from standby mode\n");
    } else {
        printf("Power on or Reset\n");
    }

    // Clear the Wake Up flag
    __HAL_PWR_CLEAR_FLAG(PWR_FLAG_WU);

    HAL_RTC_DeactivateAlarm(&hrtc, RTC_ALARM_A);
    /* USER CODE END 2 */

    ...

        if(condition) {
            HAL_RTC_GetTime(&hrtc, &sTime, RTC_FORMAT_BIN);    // BIN
            // Must call HAL_RTC_GetDate() after HAL_RTC_GetTime()
            HAL_RTC_GetDate(&hrtc, &sDate, RTC_FORMAT_BCD);    // BCD

            // Set to compare only seconds
            sAlarm.AlarmTime.Seconds        = (sTime.Seconds + 5) % 60;
            sAlarm.AlarmTime.SubSeconds     = sTime.SubSeconds;
            sAlarm.AlarmTime.SecondFraction = sTime.SecondFraction;
            sAlarm.AlarmMask          = RTC_ALARMMASK_ALL & ~RTC_ALARMMASK_SECONDS;
            sAlarm.AlarmSubSecondMask = RTC_ALARMSUBSECONDMASK_SS14_3;
            sAlarm.Alarm              = RTC_ALARM_A;
            HAL_RTC_SetAlarm_IT(&hrtc, &sAlarm, RTC_FORMAT_BIN);

            printf("Try to enter standby mode\n");

            HAL_PWR_EnterSTANDBYMode();
            printf("Failed to enter Standby mode\n");
        }
