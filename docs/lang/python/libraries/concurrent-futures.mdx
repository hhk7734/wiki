## ProcessPoolExecutor

```python
from concurrent.futures import Future, ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed

with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(func, *args) for args in args_list]
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        try:
            result = future.result()
        except Exception as e:
            # func을 실행하는 도중 발생한 예외를 처리
            pass
```

```python
from concurrent.futures import Future, ProcessPoolExecutor, wait

def callback(fut: Future):
    try:
        result = fut.result()
    except Exception as e:
        # func을 실행하는 도중 발생한 예외를 처리
        pass

with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures: list[Future] = []
    for args in args_list:
        future = executor.submit(func, *args)
        future.add_done_callback(callback)
        futures.append(future)
    wait(futures)
```
