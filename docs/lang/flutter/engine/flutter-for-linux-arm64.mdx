  ║                 Welcome to Flutter! - https://flutter.dev                  ║

  ║ The Flutter tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature usage ║
  ║ statistics and basic crash reports. This data is used to help improve      ║
  ║ Flutter tools over time.                                                   ║

  ║ Flutter tool analytics are not sent on the very first run. To disable      ║
  ║ reporting, type 'flutter config --no-analytics'. To display the current    ║
  ║ setting, type 'flutter config'. If you opt out of analytics, an opt-out    ║
  ║ event will be sent, and then no further information will be sent by the    ║
  ║ Flutter tool.                                                              ║
